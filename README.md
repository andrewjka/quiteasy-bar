# Quiteasy-bar

## About
A very simple bar that I try to put my heart into. There are no configuration files, the code I try to write simple and understandable, 
everyone can customize for themselves. Developed under the Colloid theme.

## Plans
1. realize the change of theme
2. add a pop-up menu when you click on the computer icon (In which there will be management of all sorts of things)

## How to run
